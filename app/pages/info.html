<h4>Project Title: <i>Monitoring the conservation process of the renaturated river Aa in the South of Münster</i></h4>
<p>This project is part of the course Unmanned Aerial Systems for Applied Research in Geoinformatics in the Institute for Geoinformatics, University of Münster.
    Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are highly flexible and low-cost sensor platforms that provide new opportunities for data acquisition for various environmental and geoscientific purposes.</p>
<p>The <b>goal of the project</b> was to use such platforms to monitor the conservation process of the renaturated river Aa in the South of Münster and develop a web-based GIS in order to explore and inspect the renaturation of the river Aa.
    To achieve this goal, it was captured high-resolution RGB and multispectral imagery and panoramic videos to be integrated in a webGis platform.</p>
<p>The equipments used were:  Microdrones MD4-1000, GoPro Mount and Tetracam Mini MCA 6-Channel Multispectral Camera.</p>
