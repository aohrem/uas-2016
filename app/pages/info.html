<h1>Project about</h1>

<h4>Project Title: <i>Monitoring the conservation process of the renaturated river Aa in the South of Münster</i></h4>
<p>This project is a product of the course Unmanned Aerial Systems for Applied Research in Geoinformatics in the Institute for Geoinformatics, University of Münster.
    Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are highly flexible and low-cost sensor platforms that provide new opportunities for data acquisition for various environmental and geoscientific purposes.</p>
<p>The <b>goal of the project</b> was to use such platforms to monitor the conservation process of the renaturated river Aa in the South of Münster and develop a web-based GIS in order to explore and inspect the renaturation of the river Aa.
    To achieve this goal, we captured high-resolution RGB and multispectral imagery and panoramic videos to be integrated in a webGIS platform.</p>

<p>The equipment used was: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Microdrones MD4-1000</li>
    <li>Self-developed: GoPro Mount and Tetracam </li>
    <li>Mini MCA 6-Channel Multispectral Camera</li>
    <li>Canon PowerShot SX230 HS</li>
</ul>
<p>The project was organized in 3 groups: Image Layer, Video Layer and WebGIS group</p>
