<h1>Background</h1>

<i> Renaturation “is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed.”</i>
<p style="line-height: 10px;" align="right">(Society of Ecological Restoration)</p>
<p>It is widely known, how many of the world’s ecosystems have undergone drastic degradation with negative impacts on biological diversity and peoples’ livelihoods.
    Renaturation is a process that should be deemed highly important, simply due to the great dependency we and other entities have towards any given ecosystem.

<h4>Renaturation of the Münstersche Aa River</h4>
<p>The Münstersche Aa is a river in the Münster region of Westphalia in Germany. It is a left tributary of the Ems. The Münstersche Aa begins near Havixbeck, flows southeast until Münster, and then north to Greven, where it flows into the Ems. The total length of the Münstersche Aa is about 30 km.</p>
<p>The renaturation process of the river already began in the middle of the 1980’s at the district Coerde. The parts of the river that are located south of the Aasee were began to be renatured in 1996. This project finished in the year 2002. Since then about another 12 renaturation projects were realized at different places.</p>
<p> As a result of the renaturation process the area and the perimeter have changed between 2010 and 2016. The following table shows the changes between the two years:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th>2010</th>
        <th>2016</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Area</th>
        <td>2770 m<sup>2</sup></td>
        <td>3006 m<sup>2</sup></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Perimeter</th>
        <td>541 m</td>
        <td>811 m</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Finally, the Figure 1 shows the change of the shape of the river. </p>
